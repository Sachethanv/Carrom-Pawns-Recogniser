# Carrom-Pawns-Recogniser
This project implements a Carrom Pawn Recogniser using computer vision and machine learning to detect and classify carrom pawns in real-time. It uses the YOLO object detection model to identify black, white, and queen pawns, track their positions, and automate scoring, offering gameplay analysis and insights. Built with Python and OpenCV.
